# Detecting-Sybil-Nodes-in-an-online-Social-Network
Implementation of Sybil Edge algorithm and other edge based algorithms to identify fake nodes in an online social network

• Developed and implemented an algorithm to detect new Fake IDs in online Social Networks using individual and edge-based properties and centrality notions like Degree, Betweenness, Closeness and Eigen Centrality.

• Made observations on the reject rates, target selection probability and targets' accept rates and incorporated them into a formula to classify new nodes in the network with high accuracy.

• Introduced improvements in the SybilEdge algorithm using cluster relations in the nodes of the graph of the social network generated using the Networkx library and clustered by Girvan-Newman and other algorithms.

• Tested the algorithms on the Facebook dataset available on the SNAP platform and synthetically generated graphs defined by Facebook parameterized configuration models and achieved high performance (AUC > 0.9).
